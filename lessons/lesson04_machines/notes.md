## Tinguely

### 1. **Hook with the Paradox** (2-3 min)

Start by showing one of Tinguely's drawing machines in action (video if possible, or images).

**Key talking points:**

- "Look at this machine - it's chaotic, unpredictable, sometimes it breaks down"
- "Tinguely called these 'Métamatics' - meta-automatic machines"
- "Here's the interesting part: **Tinguely built machines that reject perfection**"
- Traditional machines = precision, repeatability, control
- Tinguely's machines = chance, personality, imperfection

### 2. **Connect to Drawing** (2-3 min)

**Ask students:** "What normally makes a 'good' drawing machine?"

- (They'll likely say: accuracy, repeatability, control)

**Then flip it:**

- Tinguely asked: "What if a machine had personality? What if it was clumsy, unpredictable, even rebellious?"
- His machines would:
  - Vibrate and shake
  - Use chance (wheels, random motion)
  - Sometimes jam or break
  - Create marks that were never exactly the same twice
  - Invite audience participation (people could control speed, color, etc.)

### 3. **Bridge to Code** (3-4 min)

**The key connection:**
"Today, you're doing exactly what Tinguely did - but with code instead of motors and gears."

**Make these parallels explicit:**

| Tinguely's Physical Machines           | Your Code                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Motors, wheels, belts                  | Functions, loops, algorithms          |
| Speed controls, switches               | Variables, parameters                 |
| Vibration, friction, gravity           | Randomness, noise, physics simulation |
| Multiple arms/pens working together    | Multiple drawing agents/particles     |
| Audience interaction (buttons, levers) | Mouse, keyboard, user input           |

**Key insight to share:**
"Tinguely's genius wasn't in making machines that drew _better_ than humans - it was in making machines that drew _differently_. They had character, personality, limitations. Your code should too."

### 4. **Frame the Assignment** (2 min)

**Connect to their task:**

- "You're not trying to make a perfect drawing tool"
- "You're creating a system with its own logic, its own personality"
- "Like Tinguely, think about: What are your machine's quirks? Its constraints? What makes it interesting?"

**Provocations to leave them with:**

- What if your machine is lazy? Distracted? Overly enthusiastic?
- What if it misinterprets your input?
- What if it has a bad memory?
- What if it gets tired over time?

## Visual References to Show

If possible, show these during your intro:

- **Métamatic No. 17** (1959) - one of his most famous
- Video of Tinguely's machines in action (the mechanical motion is key)
- Examples of the actual drawings his machines produced
- **"Study for an End of the World No. 2"** (1962) - if you want to show his more extreme work about machines destroying themselves

## Optional: Quick Demo Analogy

If you have time, you could do a quick live code demo:

1. Show a simple circle following the mouse (boring, predictable)
2. Add some delay/lag (now it has inertia, like a physical object)
3. Add slight random wobble (now it has personality, like Tinguely's vibrating motors)
4. Show how these simple additions make it feel more "machine-like" and less like a perfect digital tool

This would take 2-3 minutes but really drives home the concept.
