## Computing wihtout computer

### Sollewit: [Wall drawing 118][url03] _(30 mns)_

Fifty randomly placed points all connected by straight lines.

### John H. Conway & Michael S. Patterson: [Sprouts][url02] _(30 mns)_

The game starts by drawing any number of spots. For example 3 spots. The first player has a turn by joining two of the spots and marking a new spot in the middle of the line. Or the line may start and end on the same spot.

You are not allowed to draw a line which crosses another line. A spot cannot have more than three lines leading to or from it. The idea is to make it impossible for the other player to draw a line. So the last person to draw a line is the winner.

### Moniker: [The beach](https://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/the-beach/) _(30 mns)_

Roel: "entering the beach on a sunny day you will look for an empty place and position yourself right in the middle". - A fascinating form of self organization.

### Procedural Drawing: _(30 mns)_

Develop your own procedural drawing instructions based on [Sol Lewitt's work](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) or some prompts from [Conditional Design](https://conditionaldesign.org/archive). Have one or more of you peers produce a drawing from this system.

## 🤔 Break

- Surprises, ambiguities, constraints.
- Link analog rules to computational thinking.

## Computing with computer

### 1) Getting familiar with the software

Complete the intro and some of the tutorials from [P5.js learn page](https://p5js.org/learn/)

### 2) Draw then code

Make a simple drawing and try to reproduce it with code.  
!['One with everything'](images/draw_then_code.jpg)

### 3) One with everything

Draw all possible geometric shapes you can generate with your software.  
!['One with everything'](images/one_with_everything.png)  
[> Source](https://github.com/CodeAsCreativeMedium/exercises/tree/main/01_graphic_elements/01_one_with_everything)

### 4) Iteration + randomness

Build a grid, add some randomness to it (different elements in the grid).

### 5) Map

Build a map of an imaginary place.

## Wrap-Up & Homework

- Summarize key learnings: rules, randomness, iteration.
- Exit ticket: one insight + one difficulty.

## 📂 Deliverables

- Documentation and thoughts on Computing without computers (photos, short analysis & take away from the games)
- Code and documentation on Computing with computers, start writing about it in your journal, add some gifs.
- Include a scan or photo of your drawings in the post(s).

## 📓 Journal Prompts

- How did analog rules compare to coding rules?
- Where did ambiguity or randomness lead to surprising results?
- Which historical examples inspired you?
- What was difficult about setting up your environment?

## 🗒️ To-Do for Next Week

- ✅ Install and test **local p5.js setup** on your machine (VS Code + Live Server or similar).
- ✅ Get familiar with the **journal workflow**:
  - Make a test entry in your `journal/` branch.
  - Practice adding images, code snippets, and reflections.
- ✅ Bring a small generative sketch (analog or digital) to share in Lesson 02.
