## 🎯 Focus

Structured generative systems.

## Content

### Brief

Write some code to generate tiling pattern or textural composition. Give consideration to aesthetic issues like symetry, rhythm, color, details at multiple scales; precise balance of form and the balance between organic and geometric forms. The pattern should be designed so that it is infinitely tiled or extended.

**You must first sketch your idea on paper before working with the software.**

### Variations / Steps

- [ ] Make a grid
- [ ] Animate the elements in your grid
- [ ] Experiments with 2D graphic transformations (rotation, scaling, mirror, offset)
- [ ] Use nested iterations
- [ ] Add some [easing](https://easings.net/)
- [ ] Use a kaleidoscopic effect (you can introduce image or videos as source)
- [ ] Make it loop
- [ ] Export it as a GIF
- [ ] Add states
- [ ] Add noise / randomness
- [ ] Make it "sketchy"
- [ ] Take it to the 3rd dimension

## Deliverables

- Code and documentation of your process, add some live example + gifs / images.
- Include a scan or photo of your drawings in the post

## More on patterns

A pattern is a discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper.

Try to experiment with different type of patterns, for example: Tessellations. Tessellation, or tiling in two dimensions, is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. There are many forms of tesselation and you are invited to read some of the pages below to learn more about each of those tesselation technics:

## ✎ Ideas for experiments (1)

Try to recreate some of the patterns below, add interactivity. **Start simple then complexify your system gradually.**

## ✎ Ideas for experiments (2)

<img src="images/10print.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto;">

Let's have a look at a fun little command line code originally written in Basic on the C64 in the early 80's:

`10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10`

Even though the code in itself is similar to the algorithms that generate patterns we explored before; With certain settings the visuals it produces are quite similar to outputs generated by intelligent agents programs.

Recreate a version of 10print in p5.js and create some variations

## Wrap-Up & Homework

- Summarize key learnings.

## 📂 Deliverables

- Documentation and thoughts on Computing without computers (photos, short analysis & take away from the games)
- Code and documentation on Computing with computers, start writing about it in your journal, add some gifs.
- Include a scan or photo of your drawings in the post(s).

## 📓 Journal Prompts

- How did analog rules compare to coding rules?
- Where did ambiguity or randomness lead to surprising results?
- Which historical examples inspired you?
- What was difficult about setting up your environment?

## 🗒️ To-Do for Next Week

- ✅ Install and test **local p5.js setup** on your machine (VS Code + Live Server or similar).
- ✅ Get familiar with the **journal workflow**:
  - Make a test entry in your `journal/` branch.
  - Practice adding images, code snippets, and reflections.
- ✅ Bring a small generative sketch (analog or digital) to share in Lesson 02.
