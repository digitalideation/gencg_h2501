# Lesson 03 – Clock / Time

[_Allan Tannenbaum, PATTI SMITH (FUCK THE CLOCK), 1978_](https://www.modernrocksgallery.com/bands-n-s/patti-smith-fuck-clock-tannenbaum)

Singer-songwriter Patti Smith wore her declamatory T-shirt, ironically, at a performance on New Year’s Eve 1978 at the legendary music club CBGB in New York City. Smith’s shirt was a rejection of modern, time-harried life.
Today’s attorneys are a prime examples of being “on the clock.” Charging for their services based on the Time they spend on a client’s affair, they are pressured to account ever-accruing Time as “billable hours.”

## 🎯 Focus

Represent time visually and conceptually in generative systems.

### Brief

Today we'll work on building a device visualising the passing of time. Your design should be abstract enough and appear different at all times of the day. It should incorporate some kind of cycles as well. You should prevent from using letter and digits unless it's highly relevant with your concept and used in a unique way.

While designing your clock ponder things like biological time (chronobiology), ultradian rhythms and infradian rhythms, solar and lunar cycles, celestial time, geological time, decimal time, historical time, psychological time, and subjective time. [^note-id1]

**You must first sketch your idea on paper before working with the software.**

### The concept of time

Time and movement in art are closely linked. Time, however, is an abstract concept, with cultural and historical implications. It does not have the physicality that movement does. Time-based artwork is more ephemeral.

### Linear vs. circular, or cyclical time

In the concept of linear time there is a beginning (the past), and an end (the future). Between the two is the present, which is always moving forward.

Digital clocks and time lines illustrate the idea of linear time very effecively.

In contrast, circular, or cyclical time is a repeating process, like cycles and seasons, that creates continuous and infinite outcomes. Analog clocks and labryinths are good examples of circular time.

Christiaan postma explains that the starting point with his project ‘the clock’ was a personal study about form & time. the dutch designer puts together more than 150 individual clockworks and arranges them work together to become one clock. he shows the progress of time by letting the numbers be written in words by the clockhands. reading clockwise, the time being is visible through a word and readable by the completeness of the word, 12 words from ‘one’ to ‘twelve’. the size of the clock is 1,4 by 1,4 meter.
