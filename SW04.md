## Lesson 1 & 2 ( Intro & Grid )

### Generative Computer Graphics – Fall 2025

Weeks 1–2 — Introduction and First Coding Experience (Grid)

In the first two weeks of the Generative Computer Graphics module, I gained a clear understanding of what GCG is and how it connects to the Immersive Technologies field. I learned that generative graphics are not only part of modern digital art, but also play an important role in interactive media, procedural content generation in games, and immersive experiences such as VR and AR.
We started by exploring the fundamentals of computing with code. I was introduced to p5.js, a JavaScript library designed for creative coding. As someone who enjoys drawing, this approach helped me translate traditional art concepts into programmable visuals. I began experimenting with simple shapes, colors, and animations—first trying to reproduce small sketches, then exploring grids and modifying existing code examples. This process helped me understand how visuals can be generated, controlled, and manipulated using logic, parameters, and transformations.

### Through hands-on practice, I learned the basics of:
- The p5.js environment and syntax
- Drawing shapes and customizing visual properties
- Using coordinates, loops, and variables to create patterns
- Editing and building on template code to deepen understanding
Overall, these first weeks gave me the foundation to combine creativity with computational thinking, which will be essential for future projects in the Immersive Tech program.
