## Lesson 1 & 2 ( Intro & Grid )

### Generative Computer Graphics – Fall 2025

Week 1–2 Journal Entry

In the first two weeks of the Generative Computer Graphics module, I gained a clear understanding of what GCG is and how it relates to immersive technologies. I learned that generative graphics are not manually created assets, but visuals generated through algorithms, logic, and randomness—an essential foundation for interactive and adaptive media such as VR, AR, simulations, and procedural environments.

We started by exploring the fundamentals of computing with code. Although I already have experience with JavaScript, this was my first time working with p5.js, a JavaScript library designed specifically for creative coding. As someone who enjoys drawing, this transition from traditional art to computational creativity was very motivating.

Overall, these early exercises strengthened my ability to think visually through code and showed me how generative methods can support future projects in the Immersive Tech field—such as procedural scenes, interactive UI elements, or adaptive storytelling environments.
